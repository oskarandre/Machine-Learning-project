# Deep Reinforcement Learning: Walking Agent in Unity
This project is a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) application, where we train an agent to walk autonomously from Point A to Point B in a simulated environment using **Unity**. 
The goal of the project is to create an intelligent agent that can learn how to walk and navigate a simple path using trial and error, guided by reinforcement learning techniques.
